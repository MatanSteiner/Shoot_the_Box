# Shoot_the_Box

A physics-based 2D game for Windows. The game was developed using C++ and some basic modern OpenGL.

Objective: get the rectangle through the white line on the right of the screen. To do so, shoot the circular bullet onto the rectangle.
The collision between these objects is a physically accurate elastic collision with an effect of friction between them.

Controls: [UP/DOWN] - move the bullet, [LEFT/RIGHT] - bullet velocity, [W/S] - bullet angle, [SPACE or ENTER] - shoot, [ESC] - exit
